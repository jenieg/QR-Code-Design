# My Process

### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  I learned how to use Flexbox to center the content both horiztonally and vertically. This allowed me to make a responsive and visually appealing design. This experience has enhanced my ability to create well-structured and aesthetically pleasing web layouts for future projects.

  Another important skill I acquired was the use of browser developer tools to adjust sizing and ratios on this design. These tools provide an invaluable set of resources for inspecting and modifying the design and layout of web pages in real-time.


### Continued development

In my first Frontend Mentor project, I've come to realize that there's still much to learn and explore in the world of web development. I'm eager to experiment with various methods for centering designs, seeking out best practices to improve the quality of my code. This project has inspired a desire for continuous learning and refinement, highlighting the exciting journey ahead in frontend development.
